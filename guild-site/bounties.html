            <h4>Ares Cooper</h4>
            <p>This dwarvish man was last seen taking a large caravan away from the town of Queen’s purchase. Reports say that he held up the entire caravan, taking everything of value from the passengers while ordering the caravan to continue moving. After doing so, the dwarf casted ‘flight’ on itself and flew out of the caravan. Tracing the magic he left behind yielded no results, as it seems that he only flew a short distance out of sight before leaving on foot. One of the victims is offering 700 gold for the return of their belongings.</p>

            <h4>Scar</h4>
            <p>The real name of this tiefling is currently unknown and is only described by its large scar on its face. It has been going around killing high ranking adventurers with a strange, unrecognizable magic. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FACE THEM ALONE, as this man is dangerous.</p>
