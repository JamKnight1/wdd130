        I am currently working towards a computer science degree at BYU Idaho.
        Some of my favorite things are video games, and I would love to add to that in any way I can.

        I hope that through me learning web design, I can increase my knowledge over the industry as a whole and grow as a developer.
        I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of latter day Saints for the full 21 years I've been alive.
        My favorite scripture to share is D&C 122:7
